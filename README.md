# GetUru
GetUru is a set of install scripts for Myst Online: Uru Live game clients, powered by the [H'uru fork of the Plasma Engine](https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma).

## Prerequisites
Before using Get Uru, ensure that your system has the following minimum requirements:
* [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) or higher
* [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) (optional, recommended)

## Installing the Destiny Shard
The [Destiny Shard](https://destiny.mystler.eu/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2) is a sandbox environment that can be used to test new Ages and other changes to the game. You can use GetUru to install and update a copy of Uru for use on the Destiny Shard.

To install and access Destiny, follow these instructions:
1. [Download](https://github.com/Hoikas/GetUru/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the latest snapshot of GetUru.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file you just downloaded somewhere that is easy to access, such as the desktop.
3. Open the contents of the folder you just extracted.
4. Double-click the file named `InstallDestiny`. A terminal window should appear, and the install should begin. This may take some time as the game client and game data are downloaded.
5. When the install process finishes, the terminal window should say `Press any key to continue. . .`. Press `ENTER` to close the terminal window.
6. If you have not [registered an account](https://destiny.mystler.eu/ucp.php?mode=register) on the Destiny Shard, do so at this time. Avoid using a password longer than 15 characters.
7. In the GetUru folder, there should now be a shortcut named `Start Uru`. Double click this shortcut to start the game client.
8. Login using the account you registered on the Destiny Shard forum.
